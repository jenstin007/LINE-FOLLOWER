# LINE-FOLLOWER
This is my **Line Follower Robot** project built using Arduino Uno.  
It uses 5 IR sensors to detect the path and a **PID control algorithm** to ensure smooth movement with minimal oscillation.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- 5 IR sensor array for line detection
- PID control for stability on curves
- Powered by 2 cell li ion battery
- Adjustable speed control

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- **`/code/`** â†’ Arduino code for the robot  
- **`/hardware/`** â†’ Components , parts used in making the bot
